### Overview

If you aren't familiar with a magic mirror, it is an application, typically <br>
run on a tablet that has one way film over it. The finished project shows <br>
the text that you choose to show overlayed above your reflection in the mirror<br>
It's a fun side project that I return to now and then.

### Notes

This was a fairly simple application to create. I used darksky.net to apply the <br>
temperature and other data for my application. You may notice a large box with <br>
'start listening' overlayed. This is not a flaw, but rather, a testing ground. <br>
I plan to add voice commands to the application to help flesh out the entire <br>
project in the future. For now; however, it is simply a work in progress and <br>
a pet project of mine.
